# K_means-02

**Brief**

This is an implementation of the K-means algorithm on the 'cluster analysis dataset'.

Data from the cluster analysis dataset is clustered into 2 clusters.

Tools used:

Pandas library.
Scikit-learn library.
Numpy library

**Procedure**

A dataframe is created from the cluster analysis dataset data.
K-means (clustering) algorithm is trained on the data.
Predictons are made using the model.


**How to run the notebook**
Open the notebook in a Google Colab environment.
Execute each code cell sequentially.
