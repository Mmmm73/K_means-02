# K_means-02

**Brief**

This is an implementation of the K-means algorithm on the 'cluster analysis dataset'.

Data from the cluster analysis dataset is clustered into 2 clusters.

Tools used:
1. Pandas library.
2. Scikit-learn library.
3. Numpy library

**Procedure**

1. A dataframe is created from the cluster analysis dataset data.
2. K-means (clustering) algorithm is trained on the data.
3. Predictons are made using the model.

**How to run the notebook**

Open the notebook in a Google Colab environment.
Execute each code cell sequentially.
